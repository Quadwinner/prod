## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Enhanced Simulation Mode**
While waiting for approval, improve your simulation:

```javascript
// Enhanced PNR simulation with real-looking codes
const generateRealisticPNR = () => {
  const airlines = ['AI', '6E', 'UK', 'SG', '9W'];
  const randomAirline = airlines[Math.floor(Math.random() * airlines.length)];
  const randomCode = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 6).toUpperCase();
  return randomAirline + randomCode;
};

// Example: AI7K9X2P (looks like real Air India PNR)
```

### **Option 2: Test Environment Booking**
Use Amadeus test environment for development:

```javascript
// Switch to test environment
const baseUrls = {
  test: 'https://test.api.amadeus.com',
  production: 'https://api.amadeus.com'
};

// Use test credentials (usually easier to get booking access)
```

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Real flight search and pricing ‚úÖ
- Simulated booking with realistic PNRs ‚úÖ  
- Full payment processing ‚úÖ
- Seamless user experience ‚úÖ
