# Hotel Search Frontend Updates

This document summarizes the changes made to the hotel search frontend components to ensure they work correctly with the restructured API response format.

## Changes Made

### LandingPage.jsx
- Updated the `handleSearch` function to properly handle the new API response format
- Simplified the response handling by directly using the backend-formatted hotel data
- Improved error handling with more descriptive messages
- Added proper API URL resolution from environment variables

### HotelSearchResults.jsx
- Updated both `fetchSearchResults` and `handleSearch` functions to work with the new response structure
- Added better handling of empty search results
- Improved error handling and messaging
- Fixed API URL resolution to use environment variables when available
- Ensured proper display of hotel data in the search results grid

### HotelDetails.jsx
- Updated the `fetchHotelOffer` function to handle the new API response format
- Improved fallback handling for missing hotel data (images, amenities, etc.)
- Enhanced error handling in the `handleReserveNow` function
- Made sure images are properly displayed from either direct image property or nested images object

## Data Structure

The backend now returns hotel data in a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "hotels": [
      {
        "id": "HOTEL_ID",
        "name": "Hotel Name",
        "cityCode": "LON",
        "address": {
          "countryCode": "GB"
        },
        "rating": 5,
        "price": "1413.75",
        "currency": "GBP",
        "images": [
          "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
          "https://example.com/image2.jpg"
        ],
        "amenities": [
          "24-hour Front Desk",
          "Pool",
          "Air Conditioning"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing

The hotel API integration has been tested across multiple cities (LON, PAR, NYC, SIN, DXB) and confirms that the backend is now correctly returning properly formatted hotel data that the frontend can use directly without additional processing.

## Future Improvements

- Add client-side caching for search results to reduce API calls
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Add more filters for hotel amenities and features
- Enhance the mobile UI for better user experience on smaller devices
